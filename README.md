# myfirstgaming-git-football-project
This git is for the final project of codecademy - CS101

I ended up using example made by Pranjal Dev August 8, 2022. Retrived from "https://copyassignment.com/battleship-game-code-in-python/#complete-code" 
Great way to create a battleship board and good learning experience. Although, after runnning it many times while editing some of my additional coding lines, the pogram an error.
Error consisted on on element was out of range. At first, I did not know, until I found the bug. I had to add to the letter_to_num Dict an empty key with a value 0.

At first, I got the idea on how to make up my displa_board function, but struggle in setting up a fuction to find the bishops. 

I added few things like the goal A.K.A "the rook". THe bishop and the rook are an idea I implemented for those who like playing chess.

I created a variable to keep the total of goals the player makes after finding a bishop.

Impletment random number function that will be important for the player to guess in order to score. 

The main objective is to find a bishop and then shoot to score a goal. The more bishops, the more chances to score a goal. 
If the player runs out of turn, which 21 turns is enough to play around and score, then it will be a Game Over. The program will then print a total of goals. 

You can play with another person; the winner will be whoever find the more bishops and have the greater total goals.
 
 This will serve me as an example to continue coding on my own. Still, I will continue do research to better my knowledge in python.
